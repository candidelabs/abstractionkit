# Web3Auth with Candide

This example demonstrates how to use Web3Auth as the key management and authentication solution for a Smart Account. 

It uses Server-Side Verification (SSV) via Social login. It will create a smart account and collect an asset with it.

The private key of the owner of the smart account is managed through Web3Auth auth system. The smart account is deployed in the same transaction as the miniting and collecting of the NFT.
