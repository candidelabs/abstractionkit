			title: "What is a Passkey?",
			content: (
				<p>
					A Passkey is an authentication method that eliminates the need for
					passwords entirely. Leveraging the security of your devices such as
					Touch ID and Face ID, Passkeys provide a more secure and convenient
					alternative to traditional passwords. Developed collaboratively by an
					alliance of tech companies, Passkeys adhere to the security standards
					of FIDO and WebAuthn, making them a robust authentication solution for
					various applications, not limited to web3.
				</p>
			),
		},
		{
			title: "Do Passkeys involve recovery phrases?",
			content: (
				<p>
					No, Passkeys operate without the need for recovery phrases. Ethereum
					EOA (Externally Owned Accounts) rely on a specific elliptical curve
					(secp256k1), requiring users to manage passwords or recovery phrases.
					Smart Accounts, such as Safe, can utilize programmable logic that can
					validates a difference curve, such as the one used in Passkeys
					(secp256r1) to secure account ownership and use it for signing
					transactions.

		{
			title: "Who paid for gas fees?",
			content: (
				<p>
					Gas fees in Smart Accounts can be covered by a third party through a
					feature called Paymaster. Candide Paymaster facilitate applications in
					sponsoring gas fees based on conditional gas policies. In our demo, we
					specified a gas policy to cover the gas for the account deployment and
					the NFT minting action.

		{
			title: "How can I recover an account with Passkeys",
			content: (
				<p>
					Passkey backup options vary depending on your device and password
					manager preferences. Apple device users npm utilize iCloud Keychain by
					default, while Android users rely on Google Password Manager. For
					those who prefer alternative platforms, password managers such as
					Bitwarden, 1Password, and ProtonPass offer support for Passkeys.
					Additionally, YubiKey devices are also compatible.
